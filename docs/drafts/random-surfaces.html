    <p>Random surfaces lie at the intersection of many interesting areas of study: probability,
geometry, functional analysis, and an area of theoretical physics known as
<em>Liouville Quantum Gravity</em>. 
If you're interested in starting to dig into this subject, here are some places to start,
at various levels of technicality:</p>
<ul>
<li>This <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-2d-version-of-quantum-gravity-really-works-20210617/">Quanta article</a>
is how I first found out about this subject.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05573">expository arXiv paper</a> by Ewain Gwynne is a
wonderful tour through the core of the subject of random surfaces at a bird's-eye view,
and it contains references to papers and texts which go into more detail.</li>
<li>This series of three groundbreaking papers<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, which are the subject of the article above:<ol>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7318">Liouville Quantum Gravity on the Riemann sphere</a>, 2014</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08785">Integrability of Liouville theory: proof of the DOZZ Formula</a>, 2017</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11530">Conformal bootstrap in Liouville Theory</a>, 2020</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One interesting thing about these papers is they give a mathematically-sound
construction of the Feynmann path integral in a 2D quantum field theory known as <em>Liouville Field Theory</em>.
The original physics covered in these papers was carried out in the early 80's,
but the novel thing is that this could be made mathematically rigorous. The Feynmann path
integral has always been a mythical thing to mathematicians, and there have been numerous
attempts at making it rigorous, though none seem to do it justice. (There could probably be a whole post just on those!)</p>
<p>In reading through these sources I learned about the idea of a <em>random surface</em>, which is the topic of this post. To explain,
I'll follow Gwynne and first discuss what a <em>random curve</em> is.</p>
<h1>Random Curves</h1>
<p>What is a random curve? What makes a curve "random?"</p>
<!-- It is unexpected that the Gaussian Free Field even exists. It's a random variable valued in the space $H^1(D)$ where $D \subset \mathbb{C}$ -->
<!-- is the unit disk in the complex plane, and $H^1$ is the space of _Sobolev functions_. More -->
<!-- on them later. -->
