            <ul>
                <li>
		      	<b><u>When is the final exam?</u></b><br>
			<p>
                   	For us, it will be Tuesday, June 11th at 10:15 pm. You can always find out for all of your classes at <a href="https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/examinations">this webpage</a>.
			</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
               		<b><u>Will you let us use calculators or notecards on exams?</u></b>
                    <br>
		    <p>
                    Yes, you may use a calculator and a half-sheet of notes. 
		    </p>
                </li>
		
		<li>
			<b><u>When are your office hours?</u></b>
			<br>
			<p>
			Monday 1-2pm, Thursday 1-2pm, and Friday 12-2pm. Generally on days right before homework is due.	
			</p>
		</li>
                <li>
              		<b><u>Will this class be curved?</u></b>
                   	<br>
			<p>
			The question you're probably asking is actually, "how will grades be adjusted?" I will occaisionally modify the grade ranges at the <b>end</b> of the quarter, and how much I do so will greatly depend on the performance of the class. Note: your grade will never go down from adjustment.
			</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
	                <b><u>Will you accept this late homework?</u></b>
			<br>
			<p>
			Generally, no. However, if you need an extension, you may come ask for one during office hours. Do not surprise me on or after the due date. Instead, plan ahead and ask me for an extension a few days before.
