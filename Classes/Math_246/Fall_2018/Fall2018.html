        <p> <u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> <b><u>When is the final exam?</u></b><br>
                    For us, it will be Wednesday, December 5th at 10:15 am. Life hack: you can always find out for yourself by visiting <a href="https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/examinations">this webpage</a>.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <b><u>Will you let us use calculators or notecards on exams?</u></b>
                    <br>
                    Yes, you may use a calculator and a half-sheet of notes. Math is not about memorization. I care more that you can understand what a question asks and demonstrate problem-solving ability.
                </li>
				
				<li>
					<b><u>When are your office hours?</u></b>
					<br>
					They are Thursdays from 11am to 1pm and Fridays from 3 to 5pm. 
				</li>
                <li>
                <b><u>Will this class be curved?</u></b>
                    <br>
                    The question you're probably asking is actually, "how will grades be adjusted?" I will occaisionally modify the grade ranges at the <b>end</b> of the quarter, and how much I do so will greatly depend on the performance of the class. Note: your grade will never go down from adjustment.

                <li>
                <b><u>Will you accept this late homework?</u></b>
                    <br>
                    Generally, no. However, if you need an extension, you may come ask for one during office hours. Do not surprise me on or after the due date. Instead, plan ahead and ask me for an extension a few days before.
