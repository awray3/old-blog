title: About

<img src='/images/profile.png' width=150px align=right />
I am a data scientist and mathematician based in Seattle, WA. I completed my PhD
in Algebraic Geometry at the University of Oregon in June 2020, and now I work
as a data scientist for [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/)
developing and enhancing AI-based algorithms for
[Sleeptracker](https://www.sleeptracker.com/).


In my spare time I enjoy reading science fiction, playing my guitar or piano,
and hanging out with my [cat](../images/chiyoh.png).
