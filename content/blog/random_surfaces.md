Title: Random Surfaces
Date: 2022-01-01
Summary: Meandering through the world of random surfaces.

Random surfaces lie at the intersection of many interesting areas of study: probability,
geometry, functional analysis, and an area of theoretical physics known as
_Liouville Quantum Gravity_.
There has been an explosion of activity in this area, most recently with 


Talking in general about how unexpected it might seem that the Gaussian Free Field even
exists. It's a random variable valued in the space $H^1(D)$ where $D \subset \mathbb{C}$
is the unit disk in the complex plane, and $H^1$ is the space of _Sobolev functions_. More
on them later.
