Summary: Meandering through the world of random surfaces.
Status: draft

Random surfaces lie at the intersection of many interesting areas of study: probability,
geometry, functional analysis, and an area of theoretical physics known as
_Liouville Quantum Gravity_. 
If you're interested in starting to dig into this subject, here are some places to start,
at various levels of technicality:

* This [Quanta article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-2d-version-of-quantum-gravity-really-works-20210617/)
is how I first found out about this subject.
* This [expository arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05573) by Ewain Gwynne is a
wonderful tour through the core of the subject of random surfaces at a bird's-eye view,
and it contains references to papers and texts which go into more detail.
* This series of three groundbreaking papers, which are the subject of the article above:
	1. [Liouville Quantum Gravity on the Riemann sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7318), 2014
	2. [Integrability of Liouville theory: proof of the DOZZ Formula](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08785), 2017
	3. [Conformal bootstrap in Liouville Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11530), 2020

The main interesting thing about these papers is they give a mathematically-sound
construction of the Feynmann path integral in a 2D quantum field theory known as _Liouville Field Theory_.
The original physics covered in these papers was carried out in the early 80's,
but the novel thing is that this could be made mathematically rigorous. The Feynmann path
integral has always been a mythical thing to mathematicians, and there have been numerous
attempts at making it rigorous, though none seem to do it justice. (There could probably be a whole post just on those!)
I have not read through the papers in (3) above, but they are fun to glance through to
appreciate how complicated this stuff is.



It is unexpected that the Gaussian Free Field even exists. It's a random variable valued in the space $H^1(D)$ where $D \subset \mathbb{C}$
is the unit disk in the complex plane, and $H^1$ is the space of _Sobolev functions_. More
on them later.
