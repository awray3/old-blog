Title: Use Comments in Your Terminal

Summary: You can use comments to leave yourself notes in your terminal.

You probably know that you can use comments in bash scripts by starting a line with `#`.
It also works for the terminal!

I like to use it to leave myself super short notes that I can refer back to if I'm doing
something involved in the terminal. (For longer notes I like to use [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki).)
This also gives you a fast way to search your recent notes by scrolling through your
shell's history.
